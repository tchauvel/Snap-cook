# üçΩÔ∏è Snap & Cook: Intelligent Recipe Assistant

Snap & Cook is an intelligent recipe recommendation app that uses computer vision and AI to help you discover recipes based on ingredients you already have at home.

## üß† Intelligence Features

### Ingredient Detection
- **Vision Analysis**: Take a photo of your ingredients, and our AI will identify them automatically
- **Smart Processing**: Normalizes ingredient names, filters out non-food items, and handles duplicates
- **Context Analysis**: Detects likely cuisine types and cooking techniques based on ingredient combinations

### Intelligent Recipe Matching
- **Advanced Matching Algorithm**: Scores recipes based on multiple factors:
  - Ingredient match percentage
  - Contextual relevance (time of day, cuisine type)
  - User preferences and history
  - Freshness (showing new recipes over time)
- **Partial Matching**: Recognizes similar ingredients even with different names or forms
- **Diversity Enforcement**: Ensures varied cuisine types and cooking techniques in recommendations

### User Adaptation
- **Preference Learning**: The app learns from your interactions:
  - Liked recipes boost similar cuisine types
  - Viewed recipe details update recommendations 
  - Previously seen recipes are tracked to avoid repetition
- **Ingredient Suggestions**: Intelligently suggests additional ingredients based on what you already have

## üîç How It Works

### Recipe Agent
The core of our intelligent system is the `RecipeAgent` class that:
1. Analyzes available ingredients
2. Scores recipes based on multiple factors
3. Applies diversity rules to avoid monotonous suggestions
4. Learns from user interactions to improve future recommendations

```typescript
// Example scoring algorithm (simplified)
const finalScore = (
  (ingredientMatchScore * 0.6) + 
  (contextScore * 0.2) + 
  (preferenceScore * 0.1)
) * freshness;
```

### Ingredient Agent
The `IngredientAgent` handles:
1. Processing detected ingredients from vision API
2. Normalizing ingredient names and states
3. Inferring potential missing ingredients
4. Analyzing ingredient combinations for context clues

```typescript
// Example of ingredient matching logic (simplified)
const matched = userIngredients.some(userIng => 
  recipeIngredient.toLowerCase().includes(userIng.toLowerCase()) || 
  userIng.toLowerCase().includes(recipeIngredient.toLowerCase())
);
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run start`

## üì∏ Using the App

1. **Take a Photo**: Point your camera at ingredients to detect them automatically
2. **Edit Ingredients**: Add or remove ingredients manually if needed
3. **View Recipes**: See intelligent matches based on your ingredients
4. **Refresh**: Get new recipe suggestions without repeats
5. **Like Recipes**: Improve future suggestions by marking recipes you enjoy

# Snap & Cook

Snap & Cook is a smart recipe recommendation app that helps you find recipes based on the ingredients you have at home. Just snap a photo of your pantry or fridge, and the app will suggest recipes you can make!

## Features

- üì∏ Ingredient detection from images (Claude Vision AI integration)
- ü•ó Recipe recommendations based on your pantry
- üîç Search for recipes by ingredient
- üìù Save and manage your favorite recipes
- üåê Fetches recipes from Spoonacular and other sources
- üõ°Ô∏è No sensitive API keys or secrets in this repository

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Expo CLI** (install globally with `npm install -g expo-cli`)
- **Expo Go** app on your mobile device (for testing on real devices)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tchauvel/Snap-cook.git
   cd Snap-cook
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up your API keys:**
   - The app requires API keys for Claude (Anthropic) and Spoonacular.
   - You can provide them in a `.env` file at the root of the project or directly in the config files (not recommended for production).
   - Example `.env` file:
     ```env
     CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key-here
     SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your-spoonacular-api-key-here
     ```
   - **Important:** Never commit your API keys to the repository.

4. **Configure the app:**
   - If using `.env`, make sure your config files load from environment variables (see config.ts for details).
   - You may need to restart the development server after adding or changing environment variables.

5. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```
   - Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app (iOS/Android) or run on a simulator/emulator.

## API Keys & Configuration

Snap & Cook requires API keys for:
- **Claude (Anthropic Vision API)**: For ingredient detection from images.
- **Spoonacular API**: For recipe search and recommendations.

### How to Obtain API Keys

- **Claude (Anthropic) API Key:**  
  1. Sign up at [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).
  2. Create a new API key in your account dashboard.

- **Spoonacular API Key:**  
  1. Sign up at [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
  2. Get your API key from your dashboard.

### How to Add API Keys

1. **Create a `.env` file in your project root:**
    ```env
    CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key-here
    SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your-spoonacular-api-key-here
    ```
2. **(Optional) Directly edit `config.ts`**  
   For development only, you can paste your keys in `snap-and-cook/config.ts`:
    ```ts
    export const CLAUDE_API_KEY = process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY || '';
    export const SPOONACULAR_API_KEY = process.env.SPOONACULAR_API_KEY || '';
    ```
   **Never commit your real API keys to the repository!**
3. **Restart your development server** after adding or changing environment variables.
